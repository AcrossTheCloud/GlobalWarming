    INTRODUCTION: |
      §0GOAL:§8
      Prevent global warming by offsetting furnace emissions

      §0GAMEPLAY:§8
       - §6Furnaces§8 emit CO2 when smelting
       - §6Saplings§8 absorb CO2 while growing

      §0CHALLENGE:§8
      Work together to maintain CO2 levels
    SCORES: |
      §0PLAYER SCORES:§8
      Each player has a carbon footprint score
      Your footprint is §60§8 when your CO2 emissions are balanced

      §0GLOBAL TEMPERATURE:§8
      Player scores combine to affect the global climate:
       - §614.0C§8 is the goal
    EFFECTS: |
      §0GLOBAL WARMING:§8
      CO2 levels affect global temperature:
       - §6Too high:§8 heat is trapped
       - §6Too low:§8 too much heat can escape

      §0EFFECTS:§8
       - Sea level
